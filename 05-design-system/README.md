## Turborepo

### Quick start
- `npm run dev` runs development mode on every package in parallel
- `npm run build` runs build for all packages

### Reasons to use Turborepo
- Helps to execute scripts on every package
- Speeds up building time by caching the build locally and doing an incremental build (only build stuff that has changed)
